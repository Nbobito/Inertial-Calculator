            To use this calculator, simply draw your cross-section in the 
            grid above. Each pixel represents one balsa wood strip, measuring
            3/32 of an inch. <br><br>
            This calculator assumes that the bending
            axis occurs in the center of the cross-section, meaning
            that you'll need to adjust your rows and columns in order
            to make your shape fill to the edges of the grid. The results
            have been scaled by 1000 to help with readability, 
            so be sure to divide by 1000 before using these in equations. Results are
            also colored by column, so just because one cell is greener
            doesn't mean it has the highest value; it just means it has
            the highest value for that column. <br><br>
            Left-click
            on a calculated table entry to put it back on the grid,
            and right-click to remove it. <br><br>
            That's just about it.
            Try drawing some shapes like rectangles or I-beams and see how
            their different inertias and ratios compare.
